- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In the cafe class I decided to overload the sellCoffee() method in case a customer would like to have their coffee without both cream and sugar or just cream. In the library class I chose to overload the constructor to use just the name, or the name and the address of the library because those are the two most important pieces of information about the library. Finally, in the house class I decided to overload the constructor to include the name, address, number of floors, and if it has an elevator in case someone would need to use the elevator for accessibility purposes. I also created another addition of the constructor using the name, address, and if the house has a dining room in case someone wanted to eat and needed to find the nearest dining room. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I only had a bit of trouble with figuring out how to include the super method with the showOptions() and goToFloor() methods, but after a bit of trial and error I was luckily able to figure it out. This was one of the first assignments that I didn't go to Office Hours to ask for help with, which means I'm improving and feeling more confident in my skills.
